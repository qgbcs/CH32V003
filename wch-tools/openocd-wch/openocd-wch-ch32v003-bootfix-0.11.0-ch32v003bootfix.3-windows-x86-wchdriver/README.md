# OpenOCD WCH CH32V003 BOOT Write Fix

This is a hard fork of WCH OpenOCD focused on safe writes to the CH32V003 BOOT/system storage area at `0x1ffff000`.

Project policy:

- Use the WCH OpenOCD source mirror from `cjacker/wch-openocd` as the maintenance base for this hard fork.
- Treat `openwch/openocd_wch` as a binary distribution and Arduino package index compatibility reference, not as the source maintenance base.
- Use `Seneral/riscv-openocd-wch` as a comparison reference for WCH-LinkE/SDI behavior.
- Keep CH32V003 USER flash at `0x08000000` and BOOT/system storage at `0x1ffff000` as separate address ranges.
- Do not accept OpenOCD `verify OK` alone as proof of success. Always confirm with independent USER flash and BOOT flash readback/hash checks.

## Windows Release Scope

The current Windows release is intentionally limited to `windows-x86` / `i686-mingw32` / WCHLinkDLL backend.

- It assumes the WCH official driver stack installed by WCH-LinkUtility or the WCH official driver package.
- `WCHLinkDLL.dll` and `CH347DLL.dll` are not bundled in the release zip.
- Driver replacement with Zadig, WinUSB, or libusbK is outside this release scope.
- A successful BOOT write requires OpenOCD verify, matching BOOT readback, and unchanged USER flash hash.

## Windows User Notes

- Install WCH-LinkUtility or the WCH official driver before using this release on Windows.
- This release targets the WCH official driver stack. WinUSB/libusbK configurations are not supported.
- Replacing the WCH driver with Zadig is not recommended, because coexistence with WCH-LinkUtility is prioritized.
- `WCHLinkDLL.dll` is loaded dynamically from the OS or WCH official driver stack location. It is not included in the archive.

## Basic Use

Download the binary release asset from GitHub Releases. For Arduino Boards Manager or other tool archives, use the fixed release asset URL under `/releases/download/<tag>/...zip`, not GitHub's auto-generated source archives.

After extracting the zip, use `bin/openocd.exe` together with `share/openocd/scripts` from the archive.

```powershell
bin\openocd.exe -s share\openocd\scripts -f target\wch-riscv-ch32v003.cfg
```

For CH32V003 BOOT writes, read back USER flash and BOOT/system storage before and after the write. Confirm that BOOT readback matches the requested image and that the USER flash hash is unchanged.

## CH32V003 Protection Commands

Use these commands only when the target protection state is part of the test plan. Do not treat read-protect/code-protect as per-sector write-protect.

```text
init
wch_riscv protection_status
wch_riscv read_protect_status
wch_riscv disable_read_protect confirm-user-flash-erase
```

These commands require a successfully initialized WCH-Link target session. For CH32V003, read-protect status is derived from the RDP option byte when target memory is readable, because the WCH-Link protect-status response can be stateful after option-byte reads. If option-byte readback is not available, the command falls back to the WCH-Link status response. `protection_status` also prints raw FLASH registers plus option byte / WRP bytes when read-protect is disabled. If read-protect is enabled, the command skips target-memory option/WRP reads because they can be misleading under protection.

`disable_read_protect` intentionally requires the literal confirmation token. Disabling read-protect/code-protect may erase or disturb USER flash, so capture USER/BOOT readback first and verify/rewrite USER flash afterward.

## WCH Code Erase Recovery Command

The legacy WCH adapter command syntax is preserved:

```text
code_erase CH32V003
init
shutdown
```

This is a target code flash mass-erase recovery path, not a BOOT/system flash writer. It has no address/range parameter. Use it only when the test plan explicitly accepts USER/code flash erase risk, and verify or rewrite USER flash afterward. This fork keeps the existing command shape and only strengthens risk logging plus low-level response handling.

The WCH-LinkUtility, WCHLinkDLL, and WCH-Link firmware protocol details are not treated as a public, stable specification in this project. `code_erase` is a legacy WCH adapter command preserved from the imported WCH source. This release does not claim it as a validated replacement for WCH-LinkUtility `Clear All Code Flash-By Pin NRST`; raw WCH-Link responses are logged for diagnosis and future comparison.

## Source Base

The OpenOCD code in this repository starts from the WCH OpenOCD source mirror in `cjacker/wch-openocd`.
This project does not claim that `cjacker/wch-openocd` is the exact corresponding source for the `openwch/openocd_wch` 1.0.0 binary distribution. It is treated as a maintainable hard-fork base derived from the 2024-11-26 WCH OpenOCD source mirror.

In the public history, the first commit is the imported upstream snapshot. Later commits contain the hard-fork changes. The comparison base is `upstream/cjacker-2024-11-26`:

```sh
git diff upstream/cjacker-2024-11-26..main
```

The `openwch/openocd_wch` 1.0.0 repository appears to use xPack OpenOCD as the default source in its build scripts, while the bundled `openocd.exe` still contains WCH/MounRiver patch traces such as `wlinke.c`, `wchriscv.c`, `wch_riscv`, and `wlink_set_address`. Therefore, this project treats that binary as likely produced from an xPack-style distribution framework plus WCH/MounRiver patches or a separate source tree that is not included there. It is not used as this hard fork's corresponding source or release binary.

The imported upstream README describes the source as follows:

This repo is the latest source of WCH OpenOCD **(2024-11-26 version)**.

- support WCH-Link / LinkE / LinkS / LinkW debuggers with latest firmware.
- support program / debug all WCH ch32v/x/l series MCUs and some MCU models in future.

Up to 2024-11-26, the laste firmware version:

- WCH-Link (CH549): v2.12
- WCH-LinkE (CH32V305FBP6): v2.15

**To update to latest firmware, read "[how to update firmware of WCH-Link/LinkE](https://github.com/cjacker/opensource-toolchain-ch32v#how-to-update-firmware-of-wch-linke)". If you didn't update firmware of WCH-Link/E, you may have to use [old version WCH OpenOCD](https://github.com/cjacker/wch-openocd-2022).**

## Installation

```
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/opt/wch-openocd --enable-wlinke --disable-ch347 --disable-linuxgpiod --disable-werror --program-prefix=wch-
make
sudo make install
```

After installation successfully, please add `/opt/wch-openocd/bin` to your PATH env.

## Usage

```
wch-openocd -f /opt/wch-openocd/share/openocd/scripts/target/wch-riscv.cfg

```

You may copy `wch-riscv.cfg` to your project dir to avoid such long file path.
